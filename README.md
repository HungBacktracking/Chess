# Lets Chess on Android

A small chess app for face to face games on Android phones. 

It is my first independent Android project. My aim was to practice Java and Android SDK. I also deployed this app to Play Store, to discover this process.

## about

Chess Time lets users take a face to face chess game. App supports all chess rules, including *promotion* and *en passant*.

Players can choose between two pieces style *classic* and *modern*. They can also choose, weather the app is counting game time or not.

Game can end at any time with a draw or surrendering by one player. Each player has two buttons, one dedicated to offer a draw, second to surrender. When draw button is clicked by one player, second gets notified about it and if he presses his button, game ends with a draw. Of course draw offer can be withdrawn any time before being confirmed. After clicking surrender button player is asked to confirm surrendering. If he does so, game ends with victory of second player.

After the game ends players can review the board or share it.

## code tricks

### event listeners

When adding event listeners on objecs during runtime, I used lambda expressions instead of classical way:

**classical implementation:**

```java
someButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                // your code
            });
```

**lambda implementation:**

```java
someButton.setOnClickListener(view -> {
                // your code
            });
```

### iterating through dynamically changing list

In function `mayCheckBeAvoided()` in `Game.java` I needed to iterare through list `pieces`. I coudn't use the range-based for, because order of elements in the list was changing during iteration. Function `makeKingSafe()` temporary deletes particular elements and later adds them at the end of the list. One possible solution was to use classical for loop ( `for(int i = 0; i < piece.size(); i++)`), this implementation didn't throw any exceptions, but since some of elements were being moved to the end, other were being shifted to the front. Since classical `for` iterates on indexes instead list elements, some pieces might had been passed by. Solution to that was adding new temporary list with pointers to original lists elements and use the range-based for based on it, then inside th loop make operation on oriinal list. That way I was sure, all pieces always would be checked. Example:

```java
List<Object> tempList = new ArrayList<>(originalList);
for(Object i : tempList) {
    // your code, that can change the order of the originalList 
}
```

## get it

As soon as public relase will be available on Play Store, I will post link to it here.
